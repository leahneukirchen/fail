FAIL(1)                     General Commands Manual                    FAIL(1)

NAME
     fail – crash in various possible ways

SYNOPSIS
     fail [-123Oacdikrst]

DESCRIPTION
     fail crashes in various possible ways to help you debug how other
     software reacts to this.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      Return with exit status -1.

     -2      Return with exit status 2.

     -3      Return with exit status 111.

     -O      Allocate memory in an infinite loop, to trigger an out of memory
             situation.  A dot is printed after each 16MB allocation.
             Warning: this may lock up your machine and/or result in killing
             other processes, too.  Use with caution.

     -a      Call abort().

     -c      Violate a seccomp() strict mode restriction.

     -d      Divide by zero.

     -i      Execute an illegal instruction.

     -k      Raise SIGKILL.

     -r      Trigger an infinite recursion.

     -s      Trigger a segmentation fault by writing to a null pointer.

     -t      Trigger GCC's __builtin_trap().

EXIT STATUS
     The fail utility never returns 0, because failure is inevitable.

SEE ALSO
     false(1), seccomp(2), abort(3)
