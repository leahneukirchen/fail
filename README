FAIL(1)                     General Commands Manual                    FAIL(1)

NAME
     fail – crash in various possible ways

SYNOPSIS
     fail [-123DORabcdikrst]

DESCRIPTION
     fail crashes in various possible ways to help you debug how other
     software reacts to this.

     In addition to the crashes below, fail will also cause a segmentation
     fault when its binary is loaded using dlopen(3) or LD_PRELOAD.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      Return with exit status -1.

     -2      Return with exit status 2.

     -3      Return with exit status 111.

     -D      Create a process that is in uninterruptible sleep (state D) and
             print its pid.  (This uses vfork(2) and pause(2).)

     -O      Allocate memory in an infinite loop, to trigger an out of memory
             situation.  A dot is printed after each 16MB allocation.
             Warning: this may lock up your machine and/or result in killing
             other processes, too.  Use with caution.

     -R      Trigger an infinite recursion that uses alloca(3) heavily (to
             test GCC's -fstack-clash-protection).

     -a      Call abort(3).

     -b      Trigger SIGBUS by accessing mmap(2) memory beyond the end of a
             file.

     -c      Violate a seccomp(2) strict mode restriction.

     -d      Divide by zero.

     -i      Execute an illegal instruction.

     -k      Raise SIGKILL.

     -r      Trigger an infinite recursion that uses less than a page of stack
             per level.

     -s      Trigger a segmentation fault by writing to a null pointer.

     -t      Trigger GCC's __builtin_trap().

EXIT STATUS
     The fail utility never returns 0, because failure is inevitable.
